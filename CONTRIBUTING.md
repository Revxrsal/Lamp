Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to Lamp, you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles by running `./gradlew build`.

Before you invest significant amount of efforts in building a feature or redesigning the API, please
pass it by us beforehand to ensure we are on the same ground. While we appreciate new contributions
and all the efforts done by the community, we may feel certain additions do not align with our vision
and mindset.
